# Magnets-and-pendulum-fractals
This code generates fractals that arise from starting conditions of a magnetic pendulum moving over stationary magnets
This system is chaotic and tiny changes in starting conditions will have large effects on where the pendulum ultimately ends up. By mapping the pixels of an image to starting conditions in the xy-plane I colour coded each pixel to reflect which magnet the pendulum ended over. Since the system is chaotic, this pixel colouring creates beautiful fractals. Here is an example of one of my favourites. It creates a fractal for a system of magnets forming a regular heptagon:
